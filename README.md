## Installation

To install necessary dependencies, run the following command:

```

## Usage

Once the user has installed the necessary tools it is as easy to use as typeing "node app.js" into their terminal of choice while in the parent directory and then answering the prompt questions. Once they've answered all the questions and chosed "Print Summary" they can go to the "output" directory and load "team.html" into their browser to see the finished product.
